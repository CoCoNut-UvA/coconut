# CoCoNut 

Dependencies:
- Bison
- Flex
- Cmake (> 3.13)
- GCC or Clang
- Graphviz is required if you want to turn the generated dot diagram into an image via `make dot`

For Cmake, Ubuntu 18 or older provides a very old version so it is best to add the kitware ppa or to build from source:
[cmake download](https://cmake.org/download/) or [cmake apt page](https://apt.kitware.com/)
Ubuntu 20 seems to work fine with the version present in the apt repo.

Latest version is tested on Ubuntu 20, Fedora, and WSL (Ubuntu 20).
